<h1>Scripts</h1>

Perl 6 programs usually start with a script.<br />

The first line tells the UNIX command-line which compiler to use.<br />

Sending output to the terminal is done with 'say'. It automatically adds a newline at the end of your output; if you want the cursor to remain on the same line, you can use 'print'.<br />
